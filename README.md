# Star-War-Survey-Analysis

This analysis is based on the dataset provided by FiveThirtyEight, namely Star Wars Survey. 

Original data file can be found at: 
https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey

This dataset has 1187 rows and 38 columns. Columns are questions asked by the survey regarding the Star War movies while rows are answers by each respondent. Since it contains quite some missing values, inconsistent response, and ambiguous column names for some columns, some cleansings are required before analysis can be done. 

Cleansing and analysing were done using Jupyter Notebook.
